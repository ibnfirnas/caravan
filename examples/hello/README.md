Description
-----------

Simplest example, which doesn't even contact any external systems (the intended
use-case for `caravan`), just tries simple arithmetic tests.

Usage
-----

```sh
$ make
```

The default Make target (`all`) will perform everything:

- install deps
- clean
- build
- run the example

See `Makefile` if you only want to run a subset of the operations.
